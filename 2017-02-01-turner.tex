\begin{letter}{
  The Honorable Michael Turner \\
  120 West 3rd St, Ste. 305 \\
  Dayton, OH 45402}

\opening{Dear Mr Turner,}

We wrote to you two days ago asking you to break your silence on the immigration executive order, and asked you to join Ohio's Senators and governor in condemning the administration's reckless actions, which only serve to threaten our nation's security.

Only today we saw your tweet from January 31 where you demanded the administration work with Congress to better understand immigration, security, and America's role in the world.

Please accept our tremendous thanks for voicing your opposition to this executive order and for helping check this administration's excesses.


\closing{Very respectfully,}


\end{letter}
